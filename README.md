Worklog.md
==========

A text-only system for keeping track of and analyzing information about how long
you work.

`wl.sh` includes a bashrc function that makes keeping this log easier. Just type
wl, add to the file that opens up, and close whenver you're through. Make sure
to fill out the start and end fields.

`process.py` is a parser for the worklog format.
